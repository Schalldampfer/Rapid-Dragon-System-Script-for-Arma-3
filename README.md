# Installation:
0. Copy&paste whole `functions` folder into your mission or addon.
There will be `functions\RD\` folder.
1. Merge contents in `description.ext`:
Add this code into your CfgFunctions block.
```cpp
	#include "functions\RD\fnc_rapidDragon.hpp"
```
Then, add this code into the root.
```sqf
#include "functions\RD\gui_rapidDragon.hpp"
```

2. Implementation in mission:
Create a HEMTT Rack (Contact DLC) in 3DEN editor and add this code in init window of Attributes for the rack.
```sqf
[this] call RapidDragon_fnc_init;
```
This will make the rack a Rapid Dragon Pallet with 6 Venator Cruise Missile (Jets DLC).
(If you don't have the DLCs, you can change them to any loadable object and any slow missile.)

If you have installed [USAF mod](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2397360831) then you can use the AGM-158 JASSM.
In this case the init line will be
```sqf
[this,'USAF_AGM158_LGB'] call RapidDragon_fnc_init;
```

If want to use the code out of init line of the pallet, 
you need to execute the code in both a server and all clients, 
by `remoteExec` as the script works different in servers and clients.

# How to use in-game:
1. Set Target:
* Get close to a pallet, or get in a plane which you (manually) loaded the pallets.
* Choose "Rapid Dragon Target Designation" action in the action menu.
* Select a missile from the pull down menu at top left of the GUI.
* Then click the small map to set the coordinate which you want shoot the missile at - The missile will target the position.
* You need to select all target locations for each missiles.

2. Load Pallets:
* Get close to a pallet on ground.
* Choose "Load Rapid Dragon" action in the action menu.
* The pallet will be immediately loaded into a plane nearby (within 30m). If there is no plane, then it is loaded onto a car (so that you can move it somewhere).
* If you are grounded, you can unload it in the vehicle.

* The plane should have VIV capacity enough to hold the pallet.
* If you use a smaller pallet, you can load many missiles in a plane.

* Do not use USAF's loading action and/or ACE3's cargo.
* Pallet's won't launch missiles on unloading from ACE3 cargo.

3. Launch the missiles:
* After you take off, select "Launch Rapid Dragon" action to drop one or "Unload all vehicles" to drop all pallets.
* After some seconds, the pallet will release the missiles and they go boom!
